AGLCOM = DOS async routines by me (AGL); they work rather well.

I wrote this stuff in 1987
It's a neat exercise in low-level coding, which I've always loved.
Interrupt driven serial drivers, basically.
On MS/PC-DOS, interacting with the 8250 and 16550 UARTs.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16550_UART
The 16550 had a 16 byte FIFO, which enabled us to get the higher
speeds that modems were slowly starting to support.
With the correct software, that is. Hence this code.

Now, of course, it's just for historical interest.
But I'm pretty pleased with my code from back then. I was 18.
